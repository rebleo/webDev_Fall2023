#### Final Project
Your Final Must be a contemporary responsive web site. It **not** be a portfolio site. I am not setting a page # requirement, but will be looking for evidence that you put effort into making the most technically + aesthetically sophisticated project you can.

* Original Content - no memes!
This should be a portfolio piece you can refer to after you graduate to showcase both your design + technical abilities (image-making is also a skill).

  * HTML structure with CSS styling
  * CSS - use of classes and IDs, as well as pseudo classes
  * CSS Positioning and Layout (responsive, flex or grid)
  * JavaScript Interactivity
  * Thoughtful + Appealing Design
  * Posted to your github pages
